## Usage

### For local

If you want to launch website in a local repository, do the following.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7rikazhexde/dev-insights-tips.git
```

> üö® **Note:**<br />
> **This project assumes that you have installed Poetry**
> **For Poetry installation, [check the official website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).**

```bash
poetry install
```

create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:**<br />
> **Create pre-commit and post-commit if you want to automate version updates of Pyproject.toml and tag.**
> **[Reference](https://github.com/7rikazhexde/trial-test/issues/1)**

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:**<br />
> **When I set [pre-commit-hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-configyaml---hooks) and checked the operation, I confirmed that the files under the site folder were modified multiple times.**
> **Considering the commit process, I determined that there was no need to include files under the site folder in the hook process.**
> **Therefore, I decided to add a Python script that excludes files under the generated site folder and set them to be excluded.**
>
> **The following script can be executed to include them in the [exclude](https://pre-commit.com/#config-exclude) list.**

```bash
poetry run python ci/set_pre-commit-hooks_exclude.py
```

create `.git/hooks/post-commit`

```bash
chmod +x create_post-commit.sh
./create_post-commit.sh
```
