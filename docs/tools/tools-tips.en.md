# tools tips

Here are some tools that I personally use.

## Workflowy

Outliner tool<br />
Specialized in writing and no folders so you don't have to worry about managing it.

### Download Link

[https://workflowy.com/downloads/windows/](https://workflowy.com/downloads/windows/)

### Usage

DL the application or access it from a browser and write sentences under HOME.<br />
However, since all sentences will be aggregated in HOME, it will be vertically long, so you can manage tags by using tags (#,@). You can categorize them if necessary.

#### Design Changes

The default is a white background, which can be changed in the following Theme from the three-point leader vertical (ï¸™) in the upper right corner of the screen.

```text
setting > Appearance > Theme > Dark
```

## Obsidian

A markdown editor application that can structure and decorate documents according to a "markdown" format.

### Download Link

[https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download)

### Usage

Files are stored in the vault you initially set up, but if you use Windows and iOS, you can set it to \[iCloud\]\[1\] so that you can share it with each OS.

Currently, if you do not choose iCloud as the storage location, you can only use the monthly cloud version.

\[1\]:For Windows, you need to download [iCloud for Windows](https://support.apple.com/ja-jp/HT204283).

#### Adding Plug-ins

Plug-ins are available at obsidian.<br />
You can search for and install plug-ins by changing the following settings

```bash
Settings > Third-party plugins > Community Plugins > Browse and search for PlantUML
```

For example, UML is not drawn by default, so PlantUML installation and activation will enable it.
