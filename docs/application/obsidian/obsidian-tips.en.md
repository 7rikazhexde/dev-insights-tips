A markdown editor application that can structure and decorate documents according to a "markdown" format.

### Download Link

[https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download)

### Usage

Files are stored in the vault you initially set up, but if you use Windows and iOS, you can set it to \[iCloud\]\[1\] so that you can share it with each OS.

Currently, if you do not choose iCloud as the storage location, you can only use the monthly cloud version.

\[1\]:For Windows, you need to download [iCloud for Windows](https://support.apple.com/ja-jp/HT204283).

#### Adding Plug-ins

Plug-ins are available at obsidian.<br />
You can search for and install plug-ins by changing the following settings

```bash
Settings > Third-party plugins > Community Plugins > Browse and search for PlantUML
```

For example, UML is not drawn by default, so PlantUML installation and activation will enable it.
